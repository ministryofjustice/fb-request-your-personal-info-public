# Request personal information

This is the source code for the Request personal information service built using MOJ Form Builder.

See the [handbook for Form Builder](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/fb-guide-and-runbook/#form-builder-guide-and-runbook) for more information.

To edit it, you need to install the [Form Builder Console](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/fb-editor-console-electron) application. This can also be installed from MOJ D&T Self Service if you have an MOJ Mac laptop.

## Setting up the form for development
